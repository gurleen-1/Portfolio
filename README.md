## Hey, I’m Gurleen Kaur 
A curious and detail-oriented developer who loves turning ideas into real, working projects.  
I enjoy exploring how data, logic, and design come together to solve everyday problems in smarter ways.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of code and creativity — from building machine learning models and visualizing insights to designing clean, functional systems that actually make sense to use.  
I care a lot about writing code that’s easy to understand, simple to maintain, and meaningful in what it does.

Every project I take on is a way to learn something new and push myself a little further — whether it’s experimenting with data science, web development, or a new framework I haven’t tried before.
