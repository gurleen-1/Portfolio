# About Me

I’m Gurleen Kaur, a dedicated developer and problem solver with a deep interest in data, logic, and design.  
My work blends analytical thinking with creativity — from building software systems to designing data-driven solutions that create real impact.

I enjoy exploring how technology can turn ideas into practical solutions through clear thinking, structured code, and purposeful design.  
My portfolio includes projects across data science, web development, machine learning, and visualization — each reflecting curiosity, discipline, and a constant desire to learn and improve.

I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and developing projects that are not just functional but meaningful.  
Every project is an opportunity to grow, collaborate, and contribute something valuable — connecting technical insight with thoughtful design.
